# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find a list of projects I have completed using SQL, Python, and Tableau.
As a data analyst, I did these projects to showcase many competencies from cleaning to analysing data.

## SQL
The following projects were done on SQL, with one project utilising Tableau. 

### [Project 1: Dentist office](https://github.com/vicaye28/Dentist_project.git)
* I was inspired to do this project from my work experience in a dental practice.
* I built a normalised schema to help in the registration of a patient to the 'practice'.
* Functions and procedures were made to not only add new patients but update patient's records.
* Some procedures update multiple tables at once.

### [Project 2: Parts and Suppliers](https://github.com/vicaye28/Parts_project.git)
* One of my first projects focusing on writing queries to analyse the data.
* Complex joins and conditional statements were used frequently.
* I also took the chance to create a procedure, function, trigger and event. 


### [Project 3: Club Members](https://github.com/vicaye28/club_members_clean.git)
* I wanted to do this project to showcase my ability to clean databases and make sure the data is usable for analysis. 
* I wrote queries to check for missing data, outliers and wrongly inputted data.
* Furthermore, I cleaned the data, often splitting parts of names and addresses into their distinct columns (first name, last name, state, city etc).
* To take it further, I used the cleaned database to create a Tableau Dashboard to answer questions for analysis.

## Python 
The following projects were done within python mainly using the pandas and numpy libraries 

### [Project 1: Analysis of a large movies dataset](https://github.com/vicaye28/movies.git)
* I read a clean dataframe into Pandas and performed analysis of different categories.
* I created new columns within the dataframe to work out profit and return on investment for each movie.
* I could then use it to work out the best or worst movies by creating a function to sort movies by any category I wanted.
* Matplotlib was used to generate graphs to visualise the spread in certain categories like allocated budget, revenue, etc.

### [Project 2: E-commerce sales](https://github.com/vicaye28/ecommerce.git)
* Worked on using pandas to clean data.
* I addressed null values within the data and corrected any wrong spellings.
* I corrected the date format.
* Once the dataframe was ready, I exported it as a .csv file and used it to create an analytical dashboard within Tableau.
